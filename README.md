# PIPS_Docker
This is a docker image implimentation of the PIPS USGS project. This Dockerfile is based on the 
seignovert/docker-usgs-isis3 repo that can be found [here](https://github.com/seignovert/docker-usgs-isis3).

I used this repository to install ISIS3 in the manner that my application can access ISIS3 programs from the
docker container's command line. With the help from this docker container, I successfully installed ISIS3 and Node.js into the same docker container.
